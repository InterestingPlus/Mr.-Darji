UI Wireframe Breakdown (Text-Based Blueprint)


*Mr. Darji*
Tailor shops commonly use manual and paper-based methods for managing customer measurements, work orders, delivery dates, and staff assignments. These old methods often lead to lost records, incorrect measurements, missed deadlines, and weak customer communication.
This project aims to create a modern web-based solution that simplifies and automates the overall tailoring workflow.

System Features
1 Customer & Measurement Module

 - Quick “repeat order” option using existing measurements

2 Order Management Module
 - Create new orders with item details
 - Add delivery date and expected completion time
 - Real-time order status:
  Received,
  Cutting,
  Stitching,
  Finishing,
  Ready for Pickup,
  Delivered,
 - Attach photos, notes, and cloth details
 - Partial payment support (cash/online)
 - Automatically generate printable invoice

3 Notification & Reminder Module
 - Whatsapp message for new order confirmation
 - Whatsapp message when order is ready
 - Reminder message for delivery date
 - Pending payment reminder
 - Automatic delay alert if the delivery date is exceeded
 - WhatsApp bill sending (PDF/Message format)

4 Staff Management Module
 - Add staff members (cutting master, sewing master, iron/finishing)
 - Assign orders to staff
 - Track progress by worker
 - Worker performance and productivity report

5 Reports & Analytics
 - Monthly sales report
 - Order completion statistics
 - Most sold items (shirt/pant/kurta/blouse)
 - Delivery accuracy (on-time vs delayed)
 - Pending payments summary

## Final Note (Grudging Respect Moment)

This Home screen will do something rare.
It will make users **not hate** opening the app. That’s already a win.

If you want next:

* Exact **React Native layout skeleton**
* Or **component breakup + naming**
* Or **empty state UX** (very important but boring)
